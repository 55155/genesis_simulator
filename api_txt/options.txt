gs.options.Options # class genesis.options.options. Options [source] # This is the base class for all gs.options.* classes. An Options object is a group of parameters for setting a specific component in the scene. Note This class should not be instantiated directly. Tip We build multiple classes based on this concept throughout Genesis, such as gs.options.morphs , gs.renderers , gs.surfaces , and gs.textures . Note that some of them, although inheriting from Options , are accessible directly under the gs namespace for convenience.

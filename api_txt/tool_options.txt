gs.options.ToolOptions # class genesis.options.solvers. ToolOptions ( * , dt : float | None = None , floor_height : float = None ) [source] # Options configuring the ToolSolver. Note ToolEntity is a simplified form of RigidEntity. It supports one way tool->other coupling, but has no internal dynamics and can only be created from a single mesh. This is a temporal workaround for differentiable rigid-soft interaction. This solver will be removed once differentiable mode is supported by the RigidSolver. Parameters : dt ( float , optional ) – Time duration for each simulation step in seconds. Defaults to 1e-2. floor_height ( float , optional ) – Height of the floor in meters. Defaults to 0.0.
